/-- Panorama project

My project is structured in the following way. I have implemented all the methods required for parts 3 and 4 in the
"ransac.cpp", "Stitching.cpp", and "CornerDescriptor.cpp" files. The "CornerDescriptor.cpp" file also includes a method
implemented partially from OpenCV for corner detection that I have cited. This is to make up for my incoplete assignment 2.

The main functions for Questions 1,2,3,4 is "Main_Project1234.cpp"
The main functions for ExtraCredit q1 is "Main_ExtraCredit1.txt"
The main functions for ExtraCredit q2 is "Main_ExtraCredit2.txt" the  images for this are containe in q2 file
The main functions for ExtraCredit q4 is "Main_ExtraCredit3.txt"
The main functions for ExtraCredit q5 is "Main_ExtraCredit3.txt"

to switch between Answers, simply change the extension of the appropriate files from ".txt" to ".cpp"

REQUIREMENTS

1- At the top of each main function, I import images with paths unique to my computer, you will need to update these paths
2- OpenCV 3.4.5 as well as OpenCV Contrib 3.4.5
